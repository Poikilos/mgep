    Hyptosis: "Actually I think a lot of the cream of the crop is already on there! But feel free to distribute it anywhere you want, have a good one man!
    Hyptosis: "Yeah man, all I want is credit. Anyone can use these for anything. Thanks!"

    "First thing first, I'm releasing a lot of my old art for public use. I've had so many irons in the fire for so long, it's been a really really rough past couple of weeks. Hit after hit after hit and I'm getting tired and I'm running out of money.

    I've worked on dozens of games and none of them are ever going to get finished, mostly because the programmers lost interest, but in a few cases it's just me too. Some of these art assets are just culled from projects that we may yet finish as well. Anyway, point is, here is some art for you guys to use in your games if you want!

    I'd prefer some minor percentage of ad revenue as a royalty for use, but it isn't required. I really enjoy making this kind of art, I hate to see it go to waste hiding away on my storage drives."-Hyptosis
