# mgep
Minimal Game Engine for Pygame - More Assumptions, Less Typing

## Planned Features
~: low-priority
* Examples
* Flipping direction of graphics
* (~) Recoloring

## Directives
mgep is intended for novices, learners, and anyone who wants to focus on the game creation process and is not interested in advanced principles of Pygame or Python. mgep allows you to create a game with the fewest lines possible by making helpful assumptions. For example, if you specify only the minimum parameters, you get a top view game.
