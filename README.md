# mgep
Minimal Game Engine for Pygame - More Assumptions, Less Typing

## Planned Features
~: low-priority
* Examples
* Flipping direction of graphics
* Transient effects (remove on animation end)
* Auto-generate credits
* Calculate hitboxes
* for Underworld Load 32px tileset: animated lava, animated floor spikes, water?
* (~) color key
* (~) Recoloring
* (~) Sprite overlays (clothes, weapons, 2-square sprites)
* (~) Re-edging

## Directives
mgep is intended for novices, elementary learners, and anyone who wants
to focus on the game creation process after writing few lines of code.
mgep allows you to create a game with the fewest lines possible by
making helpful assumptions.

## Usage

## Helpful Assumptions
* loading a tileset makes a top view game
* adding sprites by row, col uses last loaded tileset
* first sprite added via add_sprite is the player
